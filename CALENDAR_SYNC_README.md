NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id

```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No Google OAuth tokens found"

**Cause**: Signed in with email/password instead of Google  
**Solution**: Sign out → Sign in with Google

### Events not appearing?

**Cause**: Calendar not connected or sync disabled  
**Solution**: Go to Settings → Connect Google Calendar

### "Failed to initialize Google Calendar service"

**Cause**: Missing environment variables  
**Solution**: 
1. Check `.env.local` has GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Token expired?

**Cause**: OAuth tokens need refresh  
**Solution**: Disconnect → Reconnect in Settings

### Existing tasks not syncing?

**Cause**: Created before calendar was connected  
**Solution**: Click "Sync Now" button in Settings

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- ✅ Sign in with Google for automatic sync
- ✅ Set due dates on tasks for calendar visibility
- ✅ Use priority levels for color coding
- ✅ Check Google Calendar regularly
- ✅ Use "Sync Now" if tasks seem out of sync

### Don'ts ❌

- ❌ Don't manually edit synced events in Google Calendar (changes won't sync back)
- ❌ Don't delete the "DigiGyan Learning Tasks" calendar
- ❌ Don't revoke Google Calendar API permissions
- ❌ Don't sign in with email/password if you want sync

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Bulk Sync**: Create multiple tasks while disconnected, then connect and click "Sync Now"

2. **Calendar Colors**: Look for the specific colors:
   - 🔴 Red = High priority, needs attention
   - 🟡 Yellow = Medium priority, normal task
   - 🔵 Cyan = Low priority, when you have time

3. **Status Tracking**: Watch emojis change:
   - 📚 = Just created
   - ⚡ = Working on it
   - (Removed) = All done!

4. **Mobile App**: Install Google Calendar app to see tasks on the go

5. **Calendar Widgets**: Add Google Calendar widget to home screen

6. **Cross-Device**: Changes sync across all devices automatically
