## Educator â†” Learner Integration

### How It Works Together

**Educator Side:**
1. Educator creates course
2. Builds curriculum (sections â†’ lessons)
3. Uploads videos and content
4. Publishes course
5. Course appears in browse page

**Learner Side:**
1. Learner browses published courses
2. Views course created by educator
3. Enrolls (free or paid)
4. Watches educator's uploaded videos
5. Reads educator's lesson content
6. Completes course
7. Educator sees enrollment count increase

### Data Flow
```
Educator creates course
  â†“
Course published
  â†“
Appears in /learner/browse
  â†“
Learner enrolls
  â†“
Enrollment record created
  â†“
Learner accesses via /learner/learn
  â†“
Watches videos & completes lessons
  â†“
Progress tracked in database
  â†“
Educator sees student count
```

## Stripe Integration Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Test mode** with simulated payments
- No real API calls to Stripe
- 2-second delay to simulate processing
- Creates enrollment after "payment"
- Shows success page
- Redirects to course player

### For Production
To enable real Stripe payments:

1. **Install Stripe Elements**
```bash
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

2. **Create Payment Intent API**
```typescript
// app/api/create-payment-intent/route.ts
import Stripe from 'stripe'

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!)
  const { courseId } = await req.json()
  
  // Load course price
  const course = await supabase.from('courses').select('price').eq('id', courseId).single()
  
  // Create payment intent
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: Math.round(course.price * 100), // Convert to cents
    currency: 'usd',
    metadata: { courseId }
  })
  
  return Response.json({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret })
}
```

3. **Update Checkout Page**
```typescript
// Use Stripe Elements
import { Elements, CardElement } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js'
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'

const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!)

// In checkout flow
const { clientSecret } = await fetch('/api/create-payment-intent', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ courseId })
}).then(r => r.json())

// Confirm payment
const { error } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
  payment_method: { card: elements.getElement(CardElement) }
})
```

4. **Add Webhook Handler** (Optional but recommended)
```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const sig = req.headers.get('stripe-signature')
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret)
  
  if (event.type === 'payment_intent.succeeded') {
    const { courseId } = event.data.object.metadata
    // Create enrollment
  }
}
```
