Project Idea
An integrated Learning Management System (LMS) paired with an AI-Powered Intelligent Task Planner that transforms passive course consumption into active, organized learning with smart productivity assistance.
The platform features two primary user roles:

Educators: Create, manage, and sell courses with comprehensive content delivery
Learners: Purchase courses, consume content, and manage their learning journey with AI-assisted task planning

Core Value:

For Educators: Monetize expertise through course creation, upload lectures and materials, track student progress, and manage course offerings with payment integration
For Learners: Access quality courses, organize learning tasks with Kanban-style boards, sync with Google Calendar, receive AI-powered task assistance, and automated reminders


Description
Educator Features
Educators have complete control over course creation and management. They can structure courses with modules and lessons, upload video lectures, PDFs, and supplementary materials, and set pricing for their offerings. The platform includes integrated payment processing for seamless transactions. Educators access analytics dashboards showing enrollment numbers, completion rates, and student engagement metrics.
Learner Experience
Learners browse available courses, preview content, and purchase through secure payment integration. Once enrolled, they access course materials through an intuitive interface with progress tracking. The platform automatically generates tasks from course content, which learners can view and manage.
Intelligent Task Planner
The core differentiator is the Kanban-style task management system integrated with AI capabilities. Learners organize their learning tasks across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, Completed). Each task can be linked to specific course modules or created manually for study sessions, assignments, and deadlines.
AI Agentic Behavior: The system employs AI agents that actively assist learners by analyzing their course load, deadlines, and progress patterns. The AI can automatically break down large assignments into manageable subtasks, suggest optimal study schedules based on learning patterns, identify when students are falling behind and recommend catch-up strategies, and prioritize tasks based on urgency and course requirements.
Google Calendar Integration: Bidirectional sync allows learners to view their learning tasks alongside personal commitments, ensuring holistic time management. Tasks created in the platform appear in Google Calendar, and calendar events can be reflected in the task board.
Automated Reminder System: Smart email notifications remind learners of upcoming deadlines, scheduled study sessions, and overdue tasks. The AI considers user preferences and engagement patterns to optimize reminder timing and frequency, avoiding notification fatigue.
Task Analytics: Learners receive insights into their productivity patterns, completion rates, and time allocation across courses, helping them understand and improve their learning habits.
