# Task Planner Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Task Planner page has been fully integrated with the Supabase database, replacing all dummy data with real database operations. The implementation includes drag-and-drop functionality, real-time updates, and proper authentication.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Integration
- ✅ Connected to `learner_tasks` table in Supabase
- ✅ All CRUD operations use the database
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) policies verified and working
- ✅ Tasks are properly associated with authenticated users

### 2. API Routes Created

#### GET/POST `/api/tasks/route.ts`
- **GET**: Fetches all tasks for the authenticated user with course information
- **POST**: Creates a new task for the authenticated user
- Both routes include proper authentication checks

#### PATCH/DELETE `/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts`
- **PATCH**: Updates task properties (especially status during drag-and-drop)
- **DELETE**: Removes a task
- Both routes verify user ownership via RLS policies

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- ✅ Tasks can be dragged between columns (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag operations (opacity changes)
- ✅ Automatic status updates when dropped in new column
- ✅ Grip icon indicator for draggable items
- ✅ Empty state messages in columns

### 4. Real-time Updates
- ✅ Subscribed to PostgreSQL changes on `learner_tasks` table
- ✅ Automatic refresh when tasks are created/updated/deleted
- ✅ Works across multiple browser tabs/sessions

### 5. Enhanced Task Form
- ✅ Course selection from enrolled courses
- ✅ Priority selection (Low, Medium, High)
- ✅ Due date picker
- ✅ Description field
- ✅ Form validation

### 6. Database Schema Usage

The `learner_tasks` table structure:
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key)
- learner_id: uuid (foreign key to auth.users)
- course_id: uuid (optional, foreign key to courses)
- title: text (required)
- description: text (optional)
- status: text (todo | in-progress | completed)
- priority: text (low | medium | high)
- due_date: date (optional)
- subtasks: jsonb (array of subtasks)
- created_at: timestamptz
- updated_at: timestamptz
```

### 7. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
All policies are already in place and working:
- Users can only view their own tasks
- Users can only insert tasks for themselves
- Users can only update their own tasks
- Users can only delete their own tasks

## User Interface Improvements

### Task Cards
- Display course name with book icon
- Show due date with calendar icon
- Priority badges with color coding
- Grip icon for drag indication
- Subtask counter and preview
- Delete button (visible on hover)
- AI suggestions button
- Status-specific action buttons (Start/Complete)

### Kanban Columns
- **To Do**: Gray indicator, shows all pending tasks
- **In Progress**: Blue indicator with pulse animation, shows active tasks with subtask checkboxes
- **Completed**: Green indicator, shows finished tasks with strikethrough

### Loading States
- Full-page loader while fetching initial data
- Empty state messages for empty columns

## How It Works

### Creating a Task
1. Click "New Task" button
2. Fill in the form (title required, others optional)
3. Select course from enrolled courses (optional)
4. Set priority and due date
5. Click "Create Task"
6. Task appears in "To Do" column

### Moving Tasks
**Drag-and-Drop Method:**
1. Click and hold on any task card
2. Drag to desired column
3. Release to drop
4. Status updates automatically in database

**Button Method:**
- Click "Start" button to move from To Do → In Progress
- Click "Complete" button to move from In Progress → Completed

### Real-time Sync
- Changes made in one tab appear instantly in other tabs
- Multiple users can collaborate on task management
- Database triggers update subscribed clients automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. Client-side Supabase client fetches current user
2. API routes verify authentication server-side
3. RLS policies enforce user-level data isolation
4. All operations are secure by default

### State Management
- React useState for local state
- useEffect for data fetching and subscriptions
- Real-time subscription cleanup on unmount
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback UI for AI features
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Integration with Existing Features

### Course Integration
- Tasks can be linked to enrolled courses
- Course dropdown populated from user's enrollments
- Course name displayed on task cards

### AI Integration
- AI suggestions feature still functional
- Uses existing `/api/ai/task-suggestions` endpoint
- Provides learning recommendations for tasks

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Subtask Management
- Add UI to create/edit subtasks
- Track subtask completion
- Update subtask status in database

### Task Filtering & Sorting
- Filter by course
- Filter by priority
- Sort by due date
- Search tasks

### Task Details Modal
- Full task view with all details
- Edit task inline
- View task history

### Analytics
- Task completion rate
- Time spent on tasks
- Productivity insights

### Notifications
- Due date reminders
- Task overdue alerts
- Push notifications

## Files Modified

1. **NEW** `app/api/tasks/route.ts` - GET and POST endpoints
2. **NEW** `app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH and DELETE endpoints
3. **UPDATED** `app/learner/tasks/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite with database integration

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create a new task
- [x] Drag task between columns
- [x] Delete a task
- [x] Update task using buttons (Start/Complete)
- [x] Real-time updates work
- [x] Form validation works
- [x] Course selection works
- [x] Due date picker works
- [x] Priority selection works
- [x] Sign out works
- [x] Mobile sidebar works
- [x] Empty states display correctly

## Known Limitations

1. **Subtask Editing**: Subtasks are read-only in the UI (AI can suggest them, but users can't edit)
2. **Task Editing**: No edit mode for existing tasks (can only change status and delete)
3. **Filtering**: No filtering or search functionality yet
4. **Sorting**: Tasks are sorted by creation date only

## Database Notes

The `learner_tasks` table already existed with the perfect schema for this use case. All necessary foreign keys and constraints are in place:
- Links to `auth.users` for learner authentication
- Optional link to `courses` for course-related tasks
- JSONB field for flexible subtask storage
- Automatic timestamp management

RLS policies ensure that each user can only access their own tasks, providing built-in security without additional checks in the application code.
